# Image-Classifier
The goal of this project is to develop a model that recognizes whether the input image is of a Cat or a Dog. The model is based on classification model and trained via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques. Project is implemented using Keras Machine Learning Library in Python. 4000 Images were used to train the model which gives 80% of total accuracy. The Trained model can differentiate between a cat or a dog.

•	Used Keras libraries.

•	Keras Sequential library initialize our neural network model as a sequential network.

•	Used Keras Conv2D for Convolution Neural Network operations.

•	Used Keras Flatten for converting 2D arrays into a 1D linear vector.

•	Loading images from Kaggle Dataset for training.

•	Identifying the object based on the trained dataset.
